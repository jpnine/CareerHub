# 💼 CareerHub-Revamped

**CareerHub-Revamped** is a modernized version of my 2018 full-stack Job Portal capstone project — rebuilt with the latest **.NET 8 Minimal APIs**, **Entity Framework Core**, and a **modern frontend (React/Angular)**.  
This project demonstrates a real-world job application platform, redesigned to align with current software development best practices.
