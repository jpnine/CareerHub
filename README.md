# 💼 CareerHub

**CareerHub** is a complete modernization of my original **2018 full-stack capstone project**, which was built using the **legacy .NET Framework**.  
The primary goal of this project is to **re-architect, modernize, and future-proof** the application using **.NET 10**, modern frontend frameworks, and enterprise-grade system design best practices.

This repository serves as both a **real-world platform** and a **learning playground** for experimenting with modern backend, frontend, and infrastructure patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Modernize a legacy .NET Framework capstone project
- Apply clean architecture and system design best practices
- Build a scalable, testable, and cloud-ready application
- Support multiple frontend implementations
- Demonstrate real-world enterprise design patterns

---

## 🛠 Backend Technology Stack

- **.NET 10**
  - Minimal APIs
  - Modern ASP.NET Core patterns
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **OpenAPI / Swagger** for API documentation
- **xUnit** for unit and integration testing
- **Polly** for fault tolerance and resiliency
- **Redis** for distributed caching

---

## 🗄 Database & Persistence

Primary database:
- **MS SQL Server 2026**

Planned / alternative data stores:
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MongoDB**

Cloud-hosted databases (future roadmap):
- **Azure**
- **AWS**

---

## 🌐 Frontend Implementations

The frontend will be implemented using multiple approaches to compare architectures and UI strategies.  
Each frontend will consume the same backend APIs.

- **Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- **React**
- **Vue.js**

---

## ☁ Cloud & Infrastructure (Planned)

- Azure-hosted services
- AWS-hosted services
- Cloud-native database and caching solutions
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 🧠 Architectural Focus

- Clean Architecture
- Separation of Concerns
- Scalable API design
- Fault tolerance and resiliency
- Caching strategies
- Testability and maintainability

---

## 📌 Project Status

🚧 **Active Development / Ongoing Modernization**

This project will continue evolving as new .NET, cloud, and frontend technologies become available.
